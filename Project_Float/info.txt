1. When the float is applied it takes the element out of the flow and makes
the document believe as if it has nothing now.

2. So, in order to tackle that issue. Everytime we use float we need to clear
that float. ALWAYS!!

RULES FOR USING FLOAT 

1. Use float for its intended purpose only.

    Use float only when you want to push aside some element into the corner and 
    you want it to be filled with content. If any of these criteria 
    are missing, you shouldn't be using it, use some other css properties.


2. Parents containing floated elements will collapse

    This was the main issue I was looking for!!!
    When you use float then the parent element containing the divs which are 
    floated would collapse as it would have no any divs to contain.


3. Use CLEAR in conjuction with float
    As you alwyas use margin with padding or font-family with font-size, you 
    must use float with clear! ALL THE TIME!
